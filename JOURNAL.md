## 10/19/2025 12:10 AM - Recieved the kit and read physics  

I just recieved my kit, and I spent around 25 minutes looking at every component and their manual. I read what jumper wires do! I opened my physics from last year for around 30 mins, and I read about circuits, volts, ambers, GND, resistors, and how to calculate stuff & make a correct circuit. After that I will have to actually make one!

## 10/19/2025 12:13 AM - Learned how a breadboard works and made my first circuit!  

I read some online documentation about breadboards, and I finally understand why we use them. I show that the side lines (power lines) are connected vertically while the middle lines are connected horizontally. I also read about the LED (that the long side requires power while the other side goes to ground). I made the first circuit! Using the esp32 3v3 and GND I made a complete circuit. I also added a resistor![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzA5OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--440045a4e24197cb808fc20be3c069d6ead54063/image.png)
  

## 10/19/2025 12:16 AM - Made a more simple circuit!  

After understanding resistors and 3v3 + GND, I wanted to make a more complex circuit than just 1 LED. (I accidentally burned one because I didn't use a resistor). Here it is! I connected 5 LEDS! Basically I wired the ground and power on the side lines and then connected jumper cables vertically on the sides to pass the power / gnd on each led!
