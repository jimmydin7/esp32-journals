## 10/19/2025 - Recieved the kit and read physics  

I just recieved my kit, and I spent around 25 minutes looking at every component and their manual. I read what jumper wires do! I opened my physics from last year for around 30 mins, and I read about circuits, volts, ambers, GND, resistors, and how to calculate stuff & make a correct circuit. After that I will have to actually make one!
